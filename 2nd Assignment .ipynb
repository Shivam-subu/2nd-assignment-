    "Q4. What is a generator function in python? Why yield keyword is used? Give an example of a generator\n",

    "The yield keyword is used in a generator function to specify the value to be yielded (returned) as the next element in the sequence. When the generator function is called, it doesn't execute the entire function at once. Instead, it returns a generator object that can be iterated over. Each time the yield statement is encountered, the function pauses its execution and yields the value, which can then be accessed by the caller. The function state is saved, and the next time the generator is iterated, it resumes execution from where it left off.\n",

    "The yield keyword allows generator functions to generate values on-the-fly, lazily, and efficiently, as it doesn't require storing the entire sequence in memory.
